# Hello 🍴
[This](https://voidermalie.github.io/ohmyfood) project was part of my Web Developer course at OpenClassrooms and it showcases some fun CSS animations including
- a page-load spinner
- hearts that you can fill with *love* and *color*
- movement, movement, movement

The site itself is static, and I followed a briefing and a mockup to integrate the pages with a mobile-first approach. It is fully responsive.
